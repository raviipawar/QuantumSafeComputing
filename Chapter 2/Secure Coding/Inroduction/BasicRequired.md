(1) Linear algebra
It is the most important branch of mathematics that you need to know for quantum computing. 

(2) Complex numbers
Imaginary and complex numbers are the core mathematical base of quantum mechanics., it appears explicitly in its fundamental equations, like the Schrodinger equation. 
 
(3) Greek letters
It’s going to get really confusing really quickly once we start adding a lot of similar looking symbols if you don’t know your greek letters!

(4) Physics/quantum specific notation and constants

    i) Quantum is sometimes scary because it has very specific notation that is only used in quantum or in physics. But the concepts are similar to other fields, just have different names! 
    ii) Dirac notation or bra–ket notation, is just a simpler representation of vectors and matrices of the state of the quantum system.
    So why do we use it? It makes it easier to calculate and represent some of the quantum computing math that we do.
    iii) The Hilbert space is important in quantum computing. What's special is that you can do an inner product in a Hilbert Space - the inner product takes two vectors, and outputs a scalar (or a number). In quantum computing, it describes the space that contains the wavefunctions that are possible states of the system.

(5) What you DON’T need to know to start learning quantum computing:
    Advanced calculus or differential equations
    A full course on quantum mechanics
