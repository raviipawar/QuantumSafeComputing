**1. Cryptography**

        What is Cryptography ?

        Providing the security and protection to the data in rest or in motion.
        Cryptography lays the foundation of building the secure systems.
        There are various crypto algorithms and crypto libraries present which are used to secure system and data.


        What are the Main Pillars of Cryptography ?

        1. Authenticity
        2. Confidentiality
        3. Integrity
        4. Non Repudiation

        **Authenticity** : It  validates the origin of the message/data
                           Users can validate where the data is coming from
                           Digital certificates help achieve this

        **Confidentiality** : It ensures that the message transmitted is only visible to users authorized to see it 
                              Must guarantee the secure transmission of data across insecure channels
                              Symmetric & asymmetric encryption helps achieve this
                              
        **Data Integrity** : It deals with making sure that data is not tampered by unauthorized users 
                             Must guarantee data remains intact during transmission
                             Hashing helps achieve this
                             
        **Non-repudiation** : It enables users to guarantee the origin of the data in an undisputable manner    
                              Must guarantee that data is from who it says it is from
                              Digital signatures help achieve this
